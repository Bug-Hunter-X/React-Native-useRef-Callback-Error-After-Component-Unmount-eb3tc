This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the callback function within `useRef` is executed.  This typically happens when a component's state change triggers a re-render, but the callback inside `useRef` attempts to modify the DOM or state of the already unmounted component.  This results in a `Cannot access 'state' of null` or a similar error.
