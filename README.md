This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native involving the useRef hook and component unmounting.  The `unmountedRefBug.js` file shows the problematic code where a callback within useRef tries to access and modify state after the component has been unmounted.  The solution, provided in `unmountedRefSolution.js`, uses a cleanup function within useEffect to prevent the callback from executing after the component unmounts.
